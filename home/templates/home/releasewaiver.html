<h1> Waiver and Release of Liability</h1>

<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
  This waiver may not be modified. Signed waivers are required to participate in this event. In consideration of being allowed to participate in any way in this program, related events and activities, the undersigned acknowledges, appreciates and willingly agrees that:

1. I will comply with the stated and customary terms and conditions for participation. If, however, I observe any unusual significant hazard during my presence or participation, I will remove myself from participation and bring such to the attention of the nearest official immediately.

2. I acknowledge and fully understand that each participant will be engaging in activities that involve risk of serious injury, including traumatic brain injury, permanent disability and death, and severe social and economic losses which may result not only from their own actions, inactions or negligence but the action, inaction or negligence of others, the rules of play, or the condition of the premises or of any equipment used. Further, I accept personal responsibility for the damages following such injury, including traumatic brain injury, permanent disability or death.

3. I hereby authorize and give my full consent to Jared Kula to copyright and/or publish any and all photographs, video and/or broadcasts in which I appear while attending this event. I further agree that Jared Kula may transfer, use or cause to be used, photographs, video, or broadcasts for any exhibitions, public displays, publications, commercials, online streaming, art and advertising purposes, and television programs without limitations or reservations.

4. I knowingly and freely assume all such risk, both known and unknown, even those arising from the negligent acts or omissions of others, and assume full responsibility for my participation.

5. I, for myself and on behalf of my heirs, assigns, personal representatives and next of kin, hereby release and forever discharge Jared Kula, Nathan Keep, and others associated with the operation of this event, advertisers, and, if applicable owners and lessors of premises used to conduct the event, all of which are hereinafter referred to as “releasees”, from any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, damages, debts, losses, liabilities, indebtedness, injuries, controversies, claims for injury, disability, death, loss or damage to person or property, and causes of action either at law or in equity, and obligations or other claims of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, direct or indirect, new or existing by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, whether arising from the negligence of the releases or otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by law, which I have had, now have, or which may arise hereafter, against any of the releases arising from, in connection with, or in any way relating to my participation in this event (collectively “Claims”). I will indemnify, save and hold harmless above named releases of, from and against any loss, cost, expense, damage or liability that such releases may incur as a result of, arising from or in connection with such Claims, including without limitation any attorney's fees, or other costs or expenses or litigation.

6. I agree that I will not compete at this event while under the influence of alcohol or illegal/banned drugs. Additionally, I will not engage in any unlawful acts at such events, including but not limited to the unlawful or unauthorized use, possession, distribution or consumption of alcoholic beverages or illegal/banned drugs at said events.

7. Tournament Refund Policy
Event registration fees can be refunded as long as requests are made in writing at least 5 business days prior to the event. After that time, event registration fees will not be refunded for any circumstance. To request a refund, contact the tournament organizer listed on the event page.

8. Tournament Cancellation Policy
We aim to provide a safe environment for its events. In general, we run events rain or shine. However, if for some reason we must cancel, postpone, or relocate an event due to uncontrollable weather conditions or other circumstances beyond our reasonable control, communication will be sent to all registered participants and announcements will be made on our social networking channels.

We will do everything within our power to make sure that events take place, but the safety of our participants is our number one concern. When registering for an event, you are accepting a small risk that uncontrollable circumstances might mean events need to be modified, postponed, or cancelled. As such, no refunds will be given if a tournament is modified, postponed, or cancelled for circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

I have read this release of liability and assumption of risk agreement, fully understand its terms, and understand that I have given up substantial rights by agreeing to it and agree freely and voluntarily without any inducement.
